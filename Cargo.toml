description = """
This little library implements simple functionality for basic reading and 
writing of EXIF (related) metadata for PNG and JP(E)G image files (other file 
types - e.g. TIFF or HEIC - are planned for the future), with the advantage of 
being solely written in Rust & not relying on any 3rd party (C-)library for 
accessing the data (there are dependencies e.g. for calculating checksums or 
(de)compressing - however, they are also written in Rust).
